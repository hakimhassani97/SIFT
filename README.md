# SIFT
SIFT implementation from scratch in python with opencv  
  
here's my work about the SIFT algorithm  
  
i have two files inside the project  
  
1- 'siftOnePixel.py' calculates SIFT for one pixel specified in the lines 13,14 of the file [pixelX,pixelY]  
  
2- 'sift.py' calculates SIFT for the entire image and draws white rectangles in INTEREST POINTS  
  
you can change the threshold value for contour detection in lines 128,129 variable 'seuil'
